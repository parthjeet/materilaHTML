                    <p class="h6"><strong>WHAT IS A BUILDING FLUSH OUT?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flush out or building flush is a process to force air through a building just prior to occupancy to remove some of the pollutants, such as formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds (VOC's), that seep from newly installed components, fresh paint, materials, finishes and furnishings.</li>
                        <li>These include flooring and flooring adhesives, paints and finishes, caulks and sealants, and cabinets and work surfaces made from composite lumber products.</li>
                        <li>The flush out process aims to improve indoor air quality (IAQ) by limiting occupants&rsquo; exposure to the most intense period of contamination, and minimizing the cross-contamination between materials.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="h6"><strong>HOW TO PERFORM A FLUSH OUT?</strong></p>
                    <p>There are a host of general recommendations for performing an effective flush out of a new building.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A flush out is always conducted <strong>at the end of construction</strong> to finalize a project before occupancy.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>ventilation system components should be protected from contamination</strong> during construction, or cleaned.</li>
                        <li>The building&rsquo;s mechanical system can then circulate fresh outdoor air throughout the building.</li>
                        <li>Flush outs should take as long as possible, suggestions often range from <strong>two weeks to 30 days</strong>, but any amount of time is better than no action being taken at all.</li>
                        <li>The minimum volume of outdoor air needed for flush out is the <strong>amount needed to ventilate the full building at least once each hour</strong> (1 ACH, or air change per hour), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</li>
                        <li>At a minimum level, all mechanical ventilation systems should be set to provide the largest amount of outdoor air as practical.</li>
                        <li>It is essential that after a flush out, <strong>ventilation air filters</strong>, except filters that have only been processing outside air, <strong>are changed.</strong></li>
                        <li>The LEED rating system gives points by conducting a flush-out <strong>&ldquo;by supplying a total air volume of 14,000 cubic feet of outdoor air per square foot of floor area while maintaining an internal temperature of at least 60&deg; F and relative humidity no higher than 60%.&rdquo;</strong></li>
                        <li>An alternate approach is available if occupancy is needed before the flush out. In that case, a minimum <strong>of 3,500 cubic feet of outdoor air</strong><strong>per square foot of floor</strong> area must be delivered before the space is occupied.</li>
                        <li>It must be ventilated at a <strong>minimum rate of 0.30 cubic feet per minute</strong> (cfm) per square foot of outside air once the space is occupied (or the design minimum outside air rate determined in the LEED IEQ Prerequisite 1: Minimum Indoor Air Quality Performance, whichever is greater).</li>
                        <li>During each day of the flush-out period, <strong>ventilation must begin a minimum of 3 hours prior </strong>to occupancy and continue during occupancy during each day of the flush out.</li>
                        <li>This procedure <strong>must be followed until a total of 14,000 cubic feet per square foot of outside air has been delivered to the space.</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="h6"><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a direct link between indoor air contamination and building related illnesses.</li>
                        <li>New materials usually have the highest rate of pollution release, and as such, flush outs can reduce the negative impacts on human health.</li>
                        <li>Pollutant concentration inside a building may be two to five times higher than outside levels.</li>
                        <li>Indoor pollutants, chemical toxins, and biological agents can lead to significant health risks, including increased rates of infectious diseases, eye and respiratory irritation, allergies and asthma, chronic sinusitis, headaches, and an array of other diseases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="h6"><strong>COST</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are costs associated with building flush outs: construction management, electricity use, and lost revenue from delayed occupancy.</li>
                        <li>That being said, the avoidance of illness within the building can offset these costs.</li>
                        <li>Incorporating the flush out as part of the overall building schedule can avoid delays and minimize extra costs.</li>
                    </ul>
