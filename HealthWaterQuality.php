                    <p>In addition to providing adequate water supply for building occupants, quality of water is also a key concern. Bureau of Indian Standards has recommended a set of parameters, which should be complied with. These are given below<strong>:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                    <p>As per the CPCB, water quality standards for different classes of inland waters have been given for different applications which should be followed.</p>
                    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Critical parameters</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>COD (chemical oxygen demand)</strong> is the amount of oxygen required for the complete oxidation of biologically degradable and non-biodegradable organic matter.</li>
                        <li><strong>BOD (biochemical oxygen demand)</strong> is the quantity of oxygen required by the aerobic microorganisms to stabilize organic matter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hardness of water</strong> is caused by dissolved polyvalent, especially divalent metallic ions like Ca<sup>+2</sup> and Mg<sup>+2</sup>. Iron, strontium, barium, and manganese also contribute to hardness. The degree of hardness has been classified as soft, medium, hard, and very hard, based on the CaCO<sub>3</sub></li>
                        <li><strong>Coliform bacteria</strong> are organisms that are present in the environment and in the faeces of all warm-blooded animals and humans. The presence of coliform bacteria in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) may be present in the water system. If it is detected in water, the source of contamination should be identified and the water quality should be restored.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Various treatment techniques</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One of the options for providing quality water at low cost is to use &lsquo;package plants&rsquo;. <strong>Package plants</strong> consist of various components of the treatment process (such as chemical feeders, mixers, flocculators, sedimentation basins, and filters) in a compact assembly. As these units are assembled based on the standard designs, they are cheaper as compared to those built on-site.</li>
                        <li><strong>Slow sand filtration</strong> is a technique, which is low energy consuming and does not require high-end technical expertise to operate.</li>
                        <li>Water-treatment systems based on <strong>ion exchange and reverse osmosis</strong> can provide high quality water after removal of heavy metals, suspended solids, and so on.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>DRINKING WATER- FACTORY ACT 1948</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In every factory effective arrangements shall be made to provide and maintain at suitable points conveniently situated for all workers employed therein a sufficient supply of wholesome drinking water.</li>
                        <li>All such points shall be legibly marked &ldquo;drinking water&rdquo; in a language understood by a majority of the workers employed in the factory, and no such point shall be situated within six meters of any washing place, urinal, latrine, spittoon, open drain carrying sullage or effluent or any other source of contamination unless a shorter distance is approved in writing by the Chief Inspector.</li>
                        <li>In every factory wherein more than two hundred and fifty workers are ordinarily employed, provision shall be made for cool drinking water during hot weather by effective means and for distribution thereof.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>DRINKING WATER AND HYGIENE &ndash; ILO</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adequate supplies of clean and cooled drinking water from a reliable and regularly tested source should be made freely available at convenient locations close to all workplaces.</li>
                        <li>This is particularly important in areas where the quality of the water from piped supplies is suspect and on open worksites where workers may otherwise be tempted to refresh themselves from pools and streams liable to pollution.</li>
                        <li>In such situations it is imperative to enforce strict discipline to ensure that only designated areas are used for latrines and sanitary purposes.</li>
                        <li><em>During intensive studies on manual earth-moving operations carried out on a large dam site in India it was found that most of the workers, including those enjoying the best diets and feeding communally, were infested with intestinal parasites and had been apparently so infested for a considerable time. </em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When such conditions are present or suspected it will not be enough merely to provide clean drinking water: employers should consider it part of their responsibilities to make available suitable medicaments to combat the infestations.</p>
