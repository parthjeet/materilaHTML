        <p><strong>Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of a building&rsquo;s environment in relation to the health and wellbeing of those who occupy space within it.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>IEQ is determined by many factors, including lighting, air quality, and damp conditions.</li>
            <li>Workers are often concerned that they have symptoms or health conditions from exposures to contaminants in the buildings where they work.</li>
            <li>One reason for this concern is that their symptoms often get better when they are not in the building.</li>
            <li>While research has shown that some respiratory symptoms and illnesses can be associated with damp buildings, it is still unclear what measurements of indoor contaminants show that workers are at risk for disease.</li>
            <li>In most instances where a worker and his or her physician suspect that the building environment is causing a specific health condition, the information available from medical tests and tests of the environment is not sufficient to establish which contaminants are responsible.</li>
            <li>Despite uncertainty about what to measure and how to interpret what is measured, research shows that building-related symptoms are associated with building characteristics, including dampness, cleanliness, and ventilation characteristics.</li>
            <li>Indoor environments are highly complex and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the form of gases and particles) from office machines, cleaning products, construction activities, carpets and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.</li>
            <li>Understanding the sources of indoor environmental contaminants and controlling them can often help prevent or resolve building-related worker symptoms. Practical guidance for improving and maintaining the indoor environment is available.</li>
