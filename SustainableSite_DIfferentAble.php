                            <p>&middot; Public walks should be at least 1 200 mm wide and should have a gradient not greater than 1 in 20</p>
                            <p>&middot; Gradient of walks and driveways should be less than that prescribed for ramps, since walks would be devoid of handrails and kerbs and would be considerably longer and more vulnerable to the elements.</p>
                            <p>&middot; Walks or driveways should have a non-slip surface.</p>
                            <p>&middot; Such walks shall be of a continuing common surface not interrupted by steps or abrupt changes in level.</p>
                            <p>&middot; Wherever walks cross other walks, driveways, or parking lots they should blend to a common level.</p>
                            <p>&middot; The preferred method of meeting the requirement is to have the walk incline to the level of the street</p>
                            <p>&middot; at principal intersections, it is vitally important that the kerbs run parallel to the street, up to the point where the walk is inclined, at which point the kerb would turn in and gradually meet the level of the walk at its highest point. (refer img 9)</p>
                            <p>&middot; A walk shall have a level platform at the top which is at least 1 500 mm long, if a door swings out onto the platform or towards the walk. This platform shall extend at least 300 mm beyond each side of the doorway</p>

                            <p>&middot; Parking spaces for individuals with physical disabilities when placed between two conventional diagonal or head-on parking spaces should be 3.6 m to 3.8 m wide and the length of the aisle should 7.3 m, 6.1 m and 6.5 m for head-on, 90&deg; and 60&deg; parking respectively.</p>
                            <p>&middot; Care in planning should be exercised, so that individuals in wheelchairs and individuals using braces and crutches are not compelled to wheel or walk behind parked cars.</p>

                            <p>&middot; Where ramps with gradients are necessary or desired, they shall conform to the following requirements (refer img 10)</p>
                            <p>&middot; A ramp when provided should not have a slope greater than 1 in 20 or maximum of 1 in 12 for short distance up to 9000 mm.</p>
                            <p>&middot; A ramp shall have handrails on at least one side, and preferably two sides, that are 900 mm high, measured from the surface of the ramp, that are smooth, and that extend 300 mm beyond the top and bottom of the ramp. Where major traffic is predominantly children, the handrails should be placed 760 mm high.</p>
                            <p>&middot; A ramp shall have a surface that is non-slip surface and if length is 3 500 mm, the minimum width shall be 1 500 mm</p>
                            <p>&middot; The provision of non-slip surfaces on ramps greatly assists the challenged persons with semi ambulatory and ambulatory disabilities. Non-slip surfaces are provided by many finishes and materials. The surfaces of the concrete ramps can be made nonskid by brooming the surface or by finishing with an indenting roller.</p>
                            <p>&middot; A ramp shall have a level platform at the top which is at least 1 800 mm long, if a door swings out onto the platform or toward the ramp. This platform shall extend at least 300 mm beyond each side of the doorway (refer img 11)</p>
                            <p>&middot; Each ramp shall have at least 1 800 mm of straight clearance at the bottom.</p>
                            <p>&middot; Ramps shall have level platforms at 10 m to 12 m intervals for purposes of rest and safety, and shall have platforms minimum 1.5 m length wherever they turn.</p>
                            <p>&middot; For visually impaired people, ramps may be colour contrasted with landing.</p>
                            <p>&middot; To minimize rise to wheelchair users, ramps should be equipped with herbs approximately 50 mm high at exposed sides.</p>

                            <p><strong>3.3. Doors &amp; Doorways</strong></p>
                            <p>&middot; <strong><em>Door width: </em></strong>To enable wheelchair users to pass through doors, the minimum clear width should be 900 mm and shall be operable by a single effort. In certain cases, the clear width should be 900 mm to 1 000 mm; for example, if the wheelchair has to be turned in the doorway, where there is a door-closer or at entrance doors to public buildings and in other situations where there is considerable traffic.</p>
                            <p>&middot; <strong><em>Side-hung doors: </em></strong>To facilitate wheelchair manoeuvre, doors should be hung with the hinges in room corners. Doors opening out into corridors or circulation spaces should be avoided as far as possible.</p>
                            <p>&middot; It is recommended that all doors have kick plates extending from the bottom of the door to at least 400 mm from the floor, or be made of a material and finish that would safely withstand the abuse they might receive from canes, crutches, wheelchair foot platforms, or wheelchair wheels.</p>
                            <p>&middot; <strong><em>Wheelchair Manoeuvring Space: </em></strong>To enable wheelchair users to approach doors manoeuvring space is needed (refer img 13). A corridor should have a width of at least 1 200 mm to allow a 90&deg; turn to be made through a door. In narrow spaces sliding doors may be preferable.</p>
                            <p>&middot; <strong><em>Thresholds: </em></strong>Raised thresholds should be avoided, but where this is not possible, their height should not exceed 25 mm. Rubber thresholds are advantageous for wheelchair users.</p>
                            <p>&middot; Care should be taken in the selection, placement and setting of door closers so that they do not prevent the use of doors by the physically disabled. Time-delay door closers are recommended.</p>
                            <p>&middot; <strong><em>Self-closing doors: </em></strong>Wheelchair users and other with impaired mobility have difficulty in using self-closing doors. The force required to open them should be reduced as far as possible. Public buildings should preferably have sliding automatic doors.</p>
                            <p>&middot; <strong><em>Door Identification: </em></strong>To help people with impaired vision to see doors, the door and frame should be in a colour which contrasts with the adjoining wall. Glass or glazed doors should be marked with a colored band or frame, a little below eye-level.</p>
                            <p>&middot; <strong><em>Handles:</em></strong> Door handles and locks should be easy to manipulate. To facilitate the closing of a door by wheelchair users (for example, a water-closet compartment), the door should have a horizontal handle approximately 800 mm from the floor. Self-closing doors should be equipped with an easy gripped vertical pull-handle with a length of at least 300 mm, and with the lower end approximately 800 mm above floor. For many people and especially those with impaired vision, it is helpful to make clear whether doors are to be pulled or pushed. (see Fig. 14)</p>

                            <p>&middot; It is advantageous for wheelchair users if controls are placed at low level. For visually impaired people, they should be at eye-level.</p>
                            <p>&middot; To enable wheelchair users to reach controls while not placing them too low for visually impaired people, controls should be in the zone 900 mm to 1 200 mm from the floor. It is advantageous if controls in, for example, lifts are placed at an angle of approximately 45&deg; to the wall so that they are easier to read and operate. To cater for wheelchair users, controls should be placed not less than 400 mm from room corners. All the power and electric points should be placed at one meter above the floor level and should not project outside walls.</p>
                            <p>&middot; Again, to cater for visually impaired people, controls should be colour-contrasted with backgrounds. Information should preferably be in relief for tactile reading.</p>
