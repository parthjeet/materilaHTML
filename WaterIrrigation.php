                                landscaping</u></strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Xeriscaping</strong>

                            <p>Xeriscape means the conservation of water and energy through creative landscaping. This
                                word is derived from the Greek word, &lsquo;Xeros&rsquo;, meaning dry. These plants can
                                live with little or no supplemental watering while some are even drought tolerant.
                                Following are some recommendations to reduce water usage for landscaping.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pant a mix of native shrubs and xeriscape plants.</li>
                                <li>Reduce the lawn area, and plant more trees that require no water.</li>
                                <li>Plant palm trees, which are xerophytic, such as Phoenix dactylifera and Yucca
                                    starlite.
                                </li>
                                <li>Use ground covers such as Asparagus sprengeri, which is succulent; Pandanus dwarf,
                                    which is xerophytic; and Bougainvillea, which is a climber.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Drip irrigation</strong>

                            <p>Drip irrigation system or sub-surface drip irrigation system saves water as it avoids
                                loss of water due to run-off, deep percolation or evaporation</p>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Sprinkler irrigation</strong>

                            <p>Sprinkler irrigation is a method similar to natural rainfall in which water is
                                distributed through a system of pipes. For maintaining uniform distribution of water,
                                the pump supply system, sprinklers, and operating conditions must be designed
                                appropriately. Sprinklers are most suited to sandy soils with high infiltration rates.
                                The average application rate should be less than the basic infiltration rate of the soil
                                so as to avoid surface ponding and run-off. It is better to use sprinklers that produce
                                fine sprays than those that produce larger water droplets.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Native vegetation</strong>

                            <p>Native vegetation is original to a particular place, including trees, shrubs, and other
                                plants. Evapo-transpiration rate The PET (potential evapo-transpiration rate) is the
                                climate factor and refers to the amount of water required by a plant for its healthy
                                growth (depending on the climate). Evapo-transpiration rate determines the rate at which
                                plants lose water through evaporation. It is affected by humidity and temperature at a
                                given time. These rates vary with the season. The data is available with the Indian
                                Meteorological Department for each city and can be procured from the Additional Director
                                General of Meteorology (Research), Shivajinagar, Pune &ndash; 411 005.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Efficiencies of irrigation systems</strong>

                            <p>Irrigation efficiency refers to the ability of an irrigation system to deliver water to
                                plants without any water loss.</p>

                    <p><strong>Automatic Irrigation Timer</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A simple-to-operate automatic timer or controller can be installed on an existing manual
                            irrigation system.
                        </li>
                        <li>The controller automatically will operate the sprinklers on the proper day of the week for
                            the correct amount of run time.
                        </li>
                        <li>This will meet the plant&rsquo;s water needs as well as apply the water in off-peak night or
                            early morning hours.
                        </li>
                        <li>More elaborate controllers offer extra flexibility to manage larger sites with many
                            different hydro zones and site conditions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Any controller can use a rain or soil moisture sensor to prevent the sprinklers from
                            operating when natural precipitation has met the plants&rsquo; water needs.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&ldquo;<strong>Smart&rdquo; Controllers</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unlike traditional controllers, which are really just timers, &ldquo;smart&rdquo;
                            controllers work by monitoring and using information about site conditions (such as soil
                            moisture, rain, wind, slope, soil, plant type and more), and applying the right amount of
                            water based on those factors.
                        </li>
                        <li>These climates based &ldquo;smart&rdquo; controllers are available from many manufacturers
                            and the irrigation industry has created an evaluation program to set standards of
                            performance for this class of product.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Centralized Irrigation Controllers</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A central control system does not relieve the water manager from monitoring and adjusting
                            the equipment.
                        </li>
                        <li>It allows them to quickly adjust multiple controllers to the monthly or daily changes in
                            conditions that affect the water needs of the plants.
                        </li>
                        <li>These units can be economically justified for larger and multiple site operations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>PC Software</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Software programs have been developed to assist the designer and water manager in the
                            analysis of the efficiency of an existing or newly-designed irrigation system.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>New Sprinkler Type</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Install a multi-trajectory rotating stream sprinkler with high application uniformity.</li>
                        <li>This friction resistance head operates at lower pressures and fills the product range
                            between spray heads and rotors.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Flow Control Nozzles</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sprinklers with a uniform application rate that use the lowest possible water pressure are
                            the goal.
                        </li>
                        <li>One method that helps achieve this goal is the use of flow-control nozzles.</li>
                        <li>Each sprinkler nozzle is equipped with a flow-control device that compensates for flow
                            changes and maintains a uniform pressure.
                        </li>
                        <li>This can be a desirable feature on slopes. The flow control also acts to reduce flow should
                            a sprinkler head be broken.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Sensors</strong></p>
                    <p>Several types of sensors are available that take the human factor out of irrigation system
                        operation.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Rain shut-offs</li>
                        <li>Freeze sensors</li>
                        <li>Wind sensors</li>
                        <li>Flow sensors</li>
                        <li>Soil moisture measurement</li>
                        <li>Weather stations</li>
