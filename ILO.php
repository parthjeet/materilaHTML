                    <li>supporting the implementation of international labour standards and workplace compliance;</li>

                    <li><strong>Deduction from Wages</strong></li>
                    <li>All necessary measures should be taken to limit deductions from wages to the extent deemed to be necessary to safeguard the maintenance of the worker and his family.</li>
                    <li>Deductions from wages for the reimbursement of loss of or damage to the products, goods or installations of the employer should be authorized only when loss or damage has been caused for which the worker concerned can be clearly shown to be responsible</li>
                    <li>The amount of such deductions should be fair and should not exceed the actual amount of the loss or damage.</li>
                    <li>Before a decision to make such a deduction is taken, the worker concerned should be given a reasonable opportunity to show cause why the deduction should not be made.</li>

                                    <li>The system of minimum wages may be applied to the wage earners covered in pursuance of Article 1 of the Convention either by fixing a single minimum wage of general application or by fixing a series of minimum wages applying to particular groups of workers.</li>
                                    <li>A system based on a single minimum wage:</li>

                                            <li>need not be incompatible with the fixing of different rates of minimum wages in different regions or zones with a view to allowing for differences in costs of living;</li>
                                            <li>should not impair the effects of decisions, past or future, fixing minimum wages higher than the general minimum for particular groups of workers.</li>

                    <li>For the purposes of this Recommendation, Members may extend the term "insolvency" to other situations in which workers' claims cannot be paid by reason of the financial situation of the employer, and in particular to the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>where the enterprise has closed down or ceased its activities or is voluntarily wound up;</li>

                            <li>where, in the course of proceedings to recover a worker's claim arising out of employment, it is found that the employer has no assets or that these are insufficient to pay the debt in question;</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>wages, overtime pay, commissions and other forms of remuneration relating to work performed during a prescribed period prior to the insolvency or prior to termination of the employment. This period should be fixed by national laws or regulations and should not be less than 12 months;</li>
                            <li>holiday pay due as a result of work performed during the year in which the insolvency or the termination of the employment occurred, and in the preceding year;</li>
                            <li>amounts due in respect of other types of paid absence, end-of-year and other bonuses provided for by national laws or regulations, collective agreements or individual contracts of employment, relating to a prescribed period, which should not be less than 12 months, prior to the insolvency or prior to the termination of the employment;</li>
                            <li>payments due in lieu of notice of termination of employment;</li>
                            <li>severance pay, compensation for unfair dismissal and other payments due to workers upon termination of their employment;</li>
                            <li>compensation payable directly by the employer in respect of occupational accidents and diseases.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>The protection afforded by a privilege might cover the following claims:
                        <ul>
                            <li>contributions due in respect of national statutory social security schemes, where failure to pay adversely affects workers' entitlements;</li>
                            <li>contributions due in respect of private, occupational, inter-occupational or enterprise social protection schemes independent of national statutory social security schemes, where failure to pay adversely affects workers' entitlements;</li>
                            <li>benefits to which the workers were entitled prior to the insolvency by virtue of their participation in enterprise social protection schemes and which are payable by the employer.</li>
                            <li>Claims enumerated in subparagraphs (1) and (2) that have been awarded to a worker through an adjudication or arbitration within 12 months prior to the insolvency should be covered by the privilege regardless of the time-limits specified in those subparagraphs.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Limitations</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Where the amount of the claim protected by a privilege is limited by national laws or regulations, in order that this amount should not fall below a socially acceptable level it should take into account variables such as the minimum wage, the part of the wage which is unattachable, the wage on which social security contributions are based or the average wage in industry.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Claim which fall due after the insolvency proceedings have been opened</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Where, in accordance with national laws and regulations, an enterprise in respect of which insolvency proceedings have been opened is authorized to continue its activities, workers' claims arising out of work performed as from the date when the continuation was authorized should not be subject to the proceedings and should be paid, out of the funds available, as and when they fall due.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Accelerated payment procedures</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Where the insolvency proceedings cannot ensure rapid payment of workers' privileged claims, there should be a procedure for accelerated payment to ensure that the claims are paid, without awaiting the end of the proceedings, out of available funds or as soon as funds become available, unless the rapid payment of workers' claims is ensured by a guarantee institution.</li>
                            <li>Accelerated payment of workers' claims may be ensured as follows:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>the person or institution responsible for administering the employer's assets should pay such claims as soon as it has been determined that they are genuine and payable;</li>
                                    <li>if the claim is contested, the worker should be able to have its validity determined by a court or any other body with jurisdiction over the matter, so as to have it paid in accordance with clause (a). The accelerated payment procedure should cover the totality of the claim protected by a privilege, or at least a part of it to be fixed by national laws or regulations.</li>
                                </ul>

                    <li>the term night worker means an employed person whose work requires performance of a substantial number of hours of night work which exceeds a specified limit. This limit shall be fixed by the competent authority after consulting the most representative organizations of employers and workers or by collective agreements.</li>
                    <li>Specific measures required by the nature of night work, which shall include, as a minimum shall be taken for night workers in order to protect their health, assist them to meet their family and social responsibilities, provide opportunities for occupational advancement, and compensate them appropriately.

                <p><strong>Key principles on working-time arrangements</strong></p>
                <p><strong>■ </strong>Need for daily, weekly and perhaps annual limits on working hours</p>
                <p>■ Importance of keeping overtime exceptional, limiting the number of additional hours and providing adequate compensation</p>
                <p>■ Right to regular and uninterrupted weekly rest</p>
                <p>■ Right to paid annual leave</p>
                <p>■ Need to keep night-time work exceptional and warranting special protection</p>
                <p>■ Importance of enterprises&rsquo; needs in respect of flexible working-time arrangements</p>
                <p>■ Right to collective bargaining and the full and genuine consultation of employers&rsquo; and workers&rsquo; representatives on working-time regulation</p>
                <p>■ Need for an effective labour inspection system or other enforcement measures to prevent and punish abusive practices</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Labour inspection/administration</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The main responsibility for the implementation of wages and working-time legislation lies with governments. Ensuring compliance with national law requires labour administration and inspection systems that have efficient and effective methods of governance and management and can establish broad partnerships. Strengthening workplace compliance through labour inspection is one of the ILO&rsquo;s eight areas of critical importance recently established by the Governing Body.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Labour inspection and administration systems operate in a rapidly changing environment that is well exemplified by the TCLF industries: dramatic changes in production patterns, work organization, employment structures and relationships; labour migration; <br /> outsourcing; extended and complex global production systems; and the expansion of the informal economy. The 2011 ILC resolution concerning labour administration and labour inspection calls for sound labour inspection systems that can expand their coverage to all workers in an increasingly diverse global workforce, including workers in supply chains and export processing zones. The resolution supplements relevant ILO Conventions and Recommendations, which provide the main guidance for labour administration and inspection operations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compliance with minimum-wage and working-hours legislation remains a considerable challenge in the TCLF industries in many countries. Government action is required to improve working conditions in the TCLF industries, since governments have the legitimacy to enforce labour legislation and protect workers&rsquo; rights.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Collective bargaining agreements</strong></p>
                <p>Labour unrest in the TCLF industries in several countries has been linked to wages, hours of work and working conditions. In some cases, protests over grievances have turned violent, causing loss of life and severe injuries, while some prolonged protests have halted production and affected deliveries. Employers estimate significant losses in such cases, as on several occasions factories have been forced to close.</p>
