                    <p>Asbestos Containing Products Still Pose Dangers</p>
                    <p>Asbestos fibers are strong, durable, and resist heat, acids, and friction. They are virtually
                        indestructible. Because of these useful physical properties, asbestos fibers were often combined
                        with other materials for use in thousands of industrial, maritime, automotive, scientific and
                        building products. The following list shows the wide range of materials that could contain
                        asbestos:</p>

                        electrical panel partitions, electrical cloth, cooling towers, and chalkboards (Environmental

                    <p>Asbestos has been used in home appliances (coffee pots, toasters, irons, popcorn poppers, and
                        crock pots) and in portable heaters, portable dishwashers, wood burning stoves, and gas-fired
                        decorative logs. Until 1980, asbestos was contained in most handheld hair dryers. These are but

                    <p>Way back in 1990, the central government took an initiative to set up the Building Materials
                        &amp; Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC) to promote cost-effective, eco-friendly and energy
                        efficient building materials and technologies. Some of the natural materials that were
                        considered by BMTPC as potentially viable building materials are: 27 types of agro-industrial
                        wastes, by-products, residues, natural fibers, plantation timbers, including rice and wheat
                        husk, bagasse from sugarcane, coir, hemp etc., that are cultivated on a large scale in Indian
                        farms.</p>
                    <p>Among these building materials, some of them stand out due to their durability, cost
                        effectiveness and local availability:</p>

                                    <p>&middot; The Indian Plywood Industries Research &amp; Training Institute (IPIRTI)
                                        has developed this technique, which has proved to be a boon for the housing
                                        industries among North Eastern states.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; Since corrugated sheets are most versatile for roofing, development of
                                        corrugated sheets from bamboo mats was taken up at IPIRTI, under a project
                                        sponsored by the BMTPC.</p>

                                    <p>&middot; RHA has high reactivity and pozzolanic property, which improves the
                                        workability and solidity of the cement.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; Portland cement contains 60-65% Calcium oxide and, upon hydration, a
                                        considerable portion of lime is released as free Calcium Hydroxide.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; This is primarily responsible for the poor performance of Portland
                                        cement concretes in acidic environments. Silica present in Rice husk ash
                                        combines with the calcium hydroxide resulting in excellent resistance to acidic
                                        environments.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; RHA concrete also reduces heat evolution during slaking, increases
                                        strength, impermeability and durability by strengthening transition zone,
                                        modifying the pore-structure and also plugs the voids in the hydrated cement
                                        paste through the pozzolanic reaction.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; Minimizing the alkali-aggregate reaction, it also reduces expansion and
                                        distills pore structure and hinders diffusion of alkali ions to the surface of
                                        aggregate by micro porous structure.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; Silica in the RHA combines with the calcium hydroxide resulting in
                                        excellent resistance to the acidic environments.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; RHA mixed concrete has been found to be very workable and durable based
                                        on the several tests.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; RHA-concrete can prove to be boon for the cement and the concrete
                                        industry in several parts of the country because of large production of paddy in
                                        India.</p>

                                    <p>&middot; The concept of plastic bricks first came up in Africa when in an
                                        experimental project financed by a European Union, plastic bags were melted and
                                        transformed into bricks with a cement mold saving both money and time.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; The plastic bags were used to fill the potholes in Niger in a way to
                                        solve the problem of waste disposal.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; Plastic waste bricks are not only inexpensive but are also easily
                                        workable.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; The waste plastic is collected from various sources and then diligently
                                        sorted. It is then washed and sanitized.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; After that, it is shredded to cotton like consistency to form what is
                                        known as &lsquo;plastic cotton.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; The shredded plastic is then mixed with mud and packed away as
                                        bricks.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; Plastic bricks have been extensively used in highway and railway
                                        infrastructure.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; Plastic from the millions of the bottles and bags are melted and molded
                                        in the form of bricks are used in the construction of the roads.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; This has considerably enhanced the elastic nature of the surface helping
                                        in more load-bearing capacity of highways.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; In India, this technology has been initiated on an experimental basis
                                        for railway sleepers, but was stopped since the danger to fire is a major
                                        concern.</p>

                                    <p>&middot; Bagasse is the residual pulp from sugarcane after the juice has been
                                        extracted.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; A considerable amount of excess bagasse generated from sugar mills is
                                        left to rot or burnt as fuel for boilers.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; This by-product is now being used as a substitute for wood in particle
                                        boards that are light and low cost.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; Bagasse-based composites offer potential as the core material for
                                        laminated floors, replacing high-density and expensive wood fiberboard.</p>
                                    <p>&middot; As such, bagasse does not have enough strength and water resistance to
                                        be used on its own. However, if it is made into a laminated particle board with&nbsp;resin
                                        as a bonding agent and wax as dimensional stabilizer, then it can be used for

                                <p>&middot; Highly renewable, linoleum is made of linseed oil, cork dust, tree resins, wood flour and ground limestone.</p>

Linoleum is hypoallergenic, water-tight and available in a plethora of designs and color schemes. Boasting a lifespan of 25-40 years, linoleum that no longer can be used may be burned as fuel!</p>

                                <p>&middot; Cork flooring provides thermal insulation and acts as an acoustic barrier, making it a highly energy efficient option as well.</p>
