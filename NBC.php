                    <p><strong>INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Industrial buildings are primarily producers rather than receivers of noise. The level of industrial noise commonly exceeds that from any other source with the exception of aircraft. As compared with traffic noise, its effects are less widespread but it is often more annoying in character.</li>
                        <li>Many industrial noises contain very strong high frequency whines, screeches and clatter &mdash; these components are relatively more attenuated by passage through the air and by the insulation of light structure than are lower frequencies.</li>
                        <li>Intermittent noises are either isolated explosions or reports, or noises of a periodic nature, such as those of pressure relief valves of blow off, or the noises of work occurring at random intervals, for example, hammering, grinding and sawing operations; the latter class may be especially irritating because of high frequency components.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Sources of Industrial Noise</strong></p>
                    <p>Noises in industrial buildings are mainly of indoor origin. Noise in factories and workshops is generally caused by machine tools and by operations involved in making and handling the product and they are classified into the following groups, depending upon how the noise energy is generated.</p>

                            <p>Noise caused by impact is the most intense and widespread of all industrial noises. It is normally coupled with resonant response of the structural members connected to the impacting surface. Common sources of this type of noise are forging, riveting, chipping, pressing, tumbling, cutting, weaving, etc. Intense impact noise may also be produced during handling of materials as in the case of sheared steel plates falling one over another in collecting trays in a steel factory. Impact noise is usually intermittent and impulsive in character, but it may also be continuous as in the case of tumbling.</p>

                            <p>Most of the noise due to friction is produced in such processes as sawing, grinding and sanding. Friction also occurs at the cutting edge on lathes and other machine tools and in brakes and from bearings. The spectrum of frictional noise often predominates in high frequency and is very unpleasant in character.</p>

                            <p>A rotating or reciprocating machine generates noise due to unbalanced forces and/or pressure fluctuations in the fluids inside the machines. In many cases, the moving surfaces radiate noise directly and in other cases, the pressure fluctuations are transmitted to the outer casings of the machine from where they are radiated as noise. Interaction of rotating component with the fluid stream can also give rise to pure tone components, such as the whine in a turbine. Since most machine casings have radiation efficiencies of unity in the higher frequency range, the amount of sound radiated is often substantial.</p>

                            <p>Noise may be generated by rapid variation in air pressure caused by turbulence from high velocity air, steam or gases. Common examples are the exhaust noise from pneumatic tools and air jets. The noise is intense, and broad based in character and the frequency criteria depends on the size of the jet. The intensity increases rapidly with the velocity of the air stream.</p>

                    <p><strong>Methods of Reducing Noise</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Noise Control by Location</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Machines, processes and work areas which are approximately equally noisy should be located together as far as possible. Areas that are particularly noisy should be segregated from quiet areas by buffer zones that produce and may tolerate intermediate noise levels.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Noise Reduction by Layout</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The office space in a factory should be as far as possible located preferably in a separate building. This building should not have a wall common with the production area. Where a common wall is unavoidable, it should be heavy with few connecting doors and no permanent openings.</p>
                    <p><strong>Noise Reduction at Source</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Selection of machinery</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Noise should be reduced as near the source as possible. While the operational processes in a factory may be fixed and may have no quieter alternative, careful selection of the machine tools and equipment to be used may considerably help attaining lower noise levels in the machine shop.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Reducing noise from potential sources</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Impact that is not essential to a process should be quietened. Noise from handling and dropping of materials on hard surface may be reduced by using soft resilient materials on containers, fixing rubber tyres on trucks, trolleys, etc. Machine noise may be kept to a minimum by proper maintenance. Proper lubrication will reduce noise by friction conveyors, rollers, etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>INDUSTRIAL ZONES</strong></p>
                    <p>In the case of sub-division of land in industrial zones of area 0.8 hectare or more, 5 percent of the total area shall be reserved as amenity open space which shall also serve as a general parking space; when such amenity open space exceeds 1 500 m2, the excess area could be utilized for the construction of buildings for banks, canteens, welfare centers and such other common purposes considered necessary for the industrial user, as approved by the Authority.</p>
