                        <p>
                            <strong>Temporary seeding</strong>: Temporary seeding means growing vegetative cover for a
                            short period of time on disturbed site areas that are prone to soil erosion. Fast growing
                            grasses are used in this system whose root systems hold the soil together so that they are
                            not carried away by storm water runoff and wind. Temporary seeding also helps in reducing
                            the problem of dust from bare soil due to construction. This method of soil stabilization
                            heavily depends upon the season and rainfall rate for success. Seeding on slopes of 2:1 or
                            more, in adverse soil conditions, regions where hot or dry season is expected or where heavy
                            rains are expected should be followed by spreading mulch.

                            <strong>Earth dikes and contour trenching:</strong> An earth dike is a ridge and channel
                            arrangement constructed parallel to the contours along the face of the slope at regular
                            intervals on the lengths and slopes greater than 10% (1:10). They are used to protect the
                            work areas from upslope runoff and to divert the sediment &ndash;laden water to sediment
                            traps. They are used for reducing runoff velocity, increasing the distance of overland
                            runoff flow, and to hold moisture and minimize sediment loading of surface runoff. The dike
                            consists of compacted soil and stone, riprap or vegetation to stabilize the channel.

                            <li><strong>Mulching:</strong> Mulch is simply a protective layer of a material that is
                                spread
                                on the top of the soil. Mulching is a temporary soil stabilization technique. Mulches
                                can
                                either be organic, such as grass, hay, straw, wood chips, and similar materials, or
                                inorganic, such as stones and brick chips. Mulching should be used with seedlings and
                                plantings in steep slope areas (slopes&gt;33%). Steep slopes are prone to heavy erosion.
                                Netting or anchoring should be used to hold it in place. Other surface runoff control
                                measures like contour terracing to break up concentrated flows shall be installed prior
                                to

                                This system consists of a filter fabric which is supported by posts. A stilt fence is
                                used
                                to detain sediments from a small drainage area. A silt fence should be installed prior

                            <strong>Top soil laying:</strong> Placement of topsoil or other suitable plant material over
                            disturbed lands should be carried out to provide suitable soil medium for vegetative growth.
                            Prior to spreading the topsoil, the sub-grade shall not be loosened to a depth of 50 mm to
                            permit bonding. Topsoil shall be spread uniformly at a minimum compacted depth of 50 mm on
                            grade of 1:3 or steeper slopes; a minimum depth of 100 mm on shallower slopes is essential.
                            A depth of 300 mm is preferred on relatively flatter land. If top soil is brought from
                            another site, it is important that the texture of new soil is compatible with sub soils on
                            site. Topsoil stock piled on site should be preserved from erosion through temporary

                                practices. The foliage and roots of plants provide dust control and a reduction in

                                potential by increasing the infiltration, trapping sediment, stabilizing soil and

                            These may be either environmental functions (pertaining to improvement of soil conditions,
                            modification or microclimate, etc.) or design functions relating to creating spaces
                            enclosure, framing views, providing visual relief, etc.
                        </li>

                            <p>The functions are similar to those of trees. Shrubs may be used together with trees to
                                reinforce
                                the functions, for example, noise barrier, shelter belts, Enclosures, etc.</p>
                            <p>Other forms in which shrubs may be used are:</p>
                            <p class="padding-left-2">
                                a) Hedges &mdash; These require regular maintenance<br>
                                b) Shrubbery &mdash; Here plants are allowed to retain their natural shape; they
                                therefore
                                require little maintenance. Shrubs provide barriers, which may either be visual or
                                physical
                                (hedges). Barriers may be required in a range of situations, for example they may be
                                only
                                for defining space, or they may be required for security and have to be, therefore,
                                necessarily impenetrable.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Ground cover</strong>
                            <p>Ground cover plants are those which naturally grow to a very low height. Some of the uses
                                for
                                which they may be used are:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Stabilizing soil on steep slopes such as embankments.</li>
                                <li>As a low maintenance substitute for grass (where the surface is not to be used).
                                </li>
                                <li>For providing variety in surface treatment.</li>
                                <li>Contrast with paving materials, for example to soften rigid lines of paving.</li>
                                <li>As a subtle means of demarcating space, as for example, in places where tall plants
                                    would be
                                    visually intrusive.
                                </li>
                                <li>In combination with other plants to provide contrast or harmony in form.</li>

                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong> Climbers</strong>
                            <p>Certain climbers because of their spreading habits may also be used as ground cover (for
                                example
                                Asparagus spp.) Climbers are useful for shading exposed walls from direct sunlight. They
                                may
                                also be used for stabilizing soil on embankments (for example, Ficus stipulata, Ipomea
                                biloba).
                                On sites where a high degree of security makes fencing necessary, climbers and spreading
                                plants
                                like Bougainvillea species, may be trained on boundary wall.</p>

                    <p><strong>Planting for Shelter and Soil Conservation</strong></p>
                    <p>Benefits accruing from plantation of shelter planting may be as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduction in wind velocity resulting in the arrest of movements of sand and soil
                            particles.
                        </li>
                        <li>Prevention of soil erosion.</li>
                        <li>Modification of micro-climate; moderation of change in air temperature.</li>
                        <li>Protection of crops from being blown by high winds.</li>
                        <li>Protection of livestock.</li>
                        <li>Reduction in evaporation of soil moisture. Increase in soil moisture content varies from 3
                            percent to 7.8 percent. Water loss due to evaporation is lessened.
                        </li>
                        <li>Increase in soil moisture due to greater dewfall in sheltered areas has been found to be 200
                            percent higher than on exposed ground; heaviest dew fall is over a distance of 2 to 3 times
                            the height of the shelterbelt.
                        </li>
                        <li>Beneficial effect on growth of plants that are affected by high winds.</li>
                        <li>Extensive shelterbelts may also be used to augment the supply of fuel in rural areas.</li>
                        <li>The zone of influence of shelterbelt on crop yield extends to a distance of 20 times the
                            height of the belt, with the maximum effect being observed 10 times the height of the tree
                            belt, on the leeward side.

                    <p><strong>Recommendations for the spacing of plants windbreakers and shelter belts</strong></p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Single or double row of trees planted at <strong>0.7-1.5 m</strong>, according to
                            species.
                        </li>
                        <li>One-year-old trees are trees are used.</li>
                        <li>For a shelter belt, the common layout is a chessboard pattern provided that the
                            right distances between the fields has been chosen. These'll be efficient
                            protection if

                        <li>A mixture of species is recommended.</li>
                        <li>Within shelterbelts, close spacing of trees is the general practice. Recommended
                            spacing of shrubs is <strong>1 m and 1.5 m</strong> for trees, such as casuarina and
                            silver oak.
                        </li>
                        <li>Spacing between rows should be <strong>2.3-3 m.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>5 rows</strong> of shrubs and trees are recommended for protection from
                            winds.
