                                <p>Controlling the source of contaminants is fundamental to any IAQ strategy. Indoor contamination can also be in the form of particles or chemicals. They may come from building occupants and their activities, be emitted from furnishings and wall coverings, or be brought into the building with the intake air from outdoors. Controlling these contaminants at the source is typically a much more cost-effective strategy than filtering or diluting them once they are inside the building.</p>
                                <p><strong>Indoor Sources</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Contamination can originate inside the building or be brought in from outdoors. The most obvious indoor-generated contaminants are those created by the activities of the building occupants, such as cooking, smoking, photocopying, laser printing, and other processes.</li>
                                    <li> Low levels of <strong>VOCs</strong> originate from many different locations within the building, making local exhaust at the source difficult. In this situation, dilution with clean outdoor air is typically the most practical and cost-effective solution.</li>
                                    <li> <strong>Microbial contamination (fungi and bacteria)</strong> can also be a major source of indoor contamination. Microbiological colonies can grow in or on various building elements and furnishings, including carpets, ceilings, sheetrock walls, and within the HVAC system. Proper selection and specification of building materials and HVAC equipment are key places to start with while reducing potential microbial growth. Following methods can be used:</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p><em>Sloped, Noncorrosive Drain Pans:</em> condensate drain pans should be sloped, preferably in two directions, to assure positive drainage and eliminate standing water both when the system is operating and when it is idle. Furthermore, the drain pans should be constructed of noncorrosive materials, such as stainless or galvanized steel or polymers, to resist the deterioration that leads to premature leakage or porous surfaces.</p>
                                <p><em>Cleanability:</em> If infestations are found, these areas must be properly cleaned immediately and the cause of the contamination must be determined and corrected. The porous surface of the insulation can store dirt, creating a habitat for microbial growth if moisture is present. Once contaminated with mold, the porous insulation is almost impossible to clean short of removing and replacing it.</p>
                                <p><em>Accessibility:</em> cooling coils and drain pans must be readily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and maintenance in their normal operating position (in-situ). The equipment must be positioned and installed within the building to assure adequate access to all major components without substantial unit disassembly.</p>
                                <p><strong>Outdoor Sources</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Contaminants can also enter a building from outdoors through the outdoor air intake, or by infiltration through cracks and openings in the building envelope.</li>
                                    <li>Even outdoor air of acceptable quality can become contaminated if it is brought into the building through contaminated</li>
                                    <li>outdoor air intakes and ductwork.</li>

                                <p>ASHRAE Standard offers two methods for determining the amount of outdoor air required to properly ventilate indoor occupied spaces for acceptable IAQ:</p>
                                <p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Ventilation Rate Procedure</strong></p>
                                <p>The Ventilation Rate Procedure dictates both the quantity and quality of ventilation air necessary to assure adequate dilution of contaminants generated in the occupied space. Sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;dilution solution,&rdquo; it provides a prescriptive ventilation method for achieving acceptable indoor air quality. Specifically, it prescribes a three-step approach:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> First, determine the quality of the outdoor air. The designer cannot simply assume that the quality of the outdoor air surrounding the building is acceptable for use as ventilation air. Particulate or gaseous filtration is necessary if outdoor air exceeds the threshold levels referenced.</li>
                                    <li>Second, if the outdoor air is unacceptable, the standard advises that it be cleaned or filtered.</li>

                                </ul>
                                 <p><strong>2. </strong><strong>IAQ Procedure</strong></p>
                                <p>The Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Procedure presents an alternative, performance based method for achieving acceptable indoor air quality by setting limits on the concentration of all known and specifiable contaminants. More specifically, the IAQ Procedure sets limits for 10 contaminants, prescribes a subjective analysis to determine acceptable odor levels, and describes the use of treated, recirculated air to reduce the minimum outdoor airflow rates presented in the standard.</p>

                                <p>Filtration is a means of controlling contaminants by reducing their concentrations to acceptable levels, or by removing them from the air stream altogether. Filtration takes one or two forms, reflecting the two general types of contaminants: particulate and gaseous. Most HVAC applications implement particulate filtration to remove particles from the air brought into and recirculated within the building. To aid designers, the standard specifically addresses how to handle outdoor air known or thought to contain contaminant concentrations that exceed safe levels.</p>
                                <p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Particulate Filtration</strong></p>
                                <p>&ldquo;Particulate contaminants&rdquo; describes a broad class of airborne physical matter that exists as discrete grains or particles. Members of this class include pollen, microorganisms, skin flakes, dust, fumes, and smoke; and their particle sizes range from 0.01 to more than 100 microns. Particles of 10 microns or less generally pose the greatest health hazard because they are small enough to penetrate the natural defenses of the body&rsquo;s respiratory system. Unfortunately, their microscopic size makes them the most difficult to remove.</p>
                                <p><strong>2. </strong><strong>Gaseous Filtration</strong></p>
                                <p>Particulates are not the only contaminants of concern in recirculated and outdoor air streams. When inside a building, concentrations of certain gases and vapors can be detrimental to occupant health. The most common gaseous indoor contaminants include carbon monoxide, radon, oxidants (ozone), nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde and toluene. Controlling VOC concentrations pose a special challenge. Filtration and source control are difficult because a building contains thousands of different VOCs of countless origins, including construction materials, furnishings, and cleaning supplies.</p>
