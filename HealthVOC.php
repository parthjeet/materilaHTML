                    <p><strong>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)</strong> are emitted as gases from certain solids or
                        liquids. VOCs include a variety of chemicals, some of which may have short- and long-term
                        adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten
                        times higher) than outdoors. VOCs are emitted by a wide array of products numbering in the
                        thousands.</p>
                    <p><strong>Organic chemicals</strong> are widely used as ingredients in household products. Paints,
                        varnishes and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic,
                        degreasing and hobby products. Fuels are made up of organic chemicals. All of these products can
                        release organic compounds while you are using them, and, to some degree, when they are stored.

                        highly toxic, to those with no known health effect.</p>
                    <p>As with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect will depend on many factors
                        including level of exposure and length of time exposed. Among the immediate symptoms that some
                        people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eye and respiratory tract irritation</li>

                    <p class="h5"><strong>STEPS TO REDUCE EXPOSURE</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increase ventilation when using products that emit VOCs.</li>
                        <li>Meet or exceed any label precautions.</li>
                        <li>Do not store opened containers of unused paints and similar materials within the school.
                        </li>
                        <li>Formaldehyde, one of the best known VOCs, is one of the few indoor air pollutants that can
                            be readily measured.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Identify, and if possible, remove the source.</li>
                                <li>If not possible to remove, reduce exposure by using a sealant on all exposed
                                    surfaces of paneling and other furnishings.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Use integrated pest management techniques to reduce the need for pesticides.</li>
                        <li>Use products according to manufacturer's directions.</li>
                        <li>Make sure you provide plenty of fresh air when using these products.</li>
                        <li>Throw away unused or little-used containers safely; buy in quantities that you will use
                            soon.
                        </li>
                        <li>Never mix care products unless directed on the label.</li>

                                    windows to provide the maximum amount of outdoor air possible.</p>

                                    to keep are stored not only in a well-ventilated area but are also safely out of
                                    reach of children.) Do not simply toss these unwanted products in the garbage can.
                                    Find out if your local government or any organization in your community sponsors
                                    special days for the collection of toxic household wastes. If such days are
                                    available, use them to dispose of the unwanted containers safely. If no such
                                    collection days are available, think about organizing one.</p>

                                    can cause symptoms associated with exposure to carbon monoxide. Carefully read the

                                    products. Use products that contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use
