                    <p><strong>1.2 Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests (MoEF)- EIA</strong></p>
                    <p>Environmental protection has been considered as an important domain for industrial and other developmental activities in India. Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests (MoEF) has taken several policy initiatives and promoted integration of environmental concerns in developmental projects. One such initiative is the notification on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of developmental projects issued in 1994 and further revised notification in year 2006 under the provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. EIA is now mandatory for 40 categories for developmental projects. EIA Guidance Manual for building, construction, townships and area development projects proactively talks about the importance of green belts in such projects.</p>
                    <p>Environmental Guidelines for Industries developed by MoEF, suggest that the industries must care about the surrounding environment and minimize the adverse impacts of industrial operations in the immediate neighborhood as well as distant places. Therefore, these guidelines mandate project owners to maintain the certain distances by the industries from the areas like ecologically sensitive areas, Coastal areas, Flood Plain of the Riverine Systems, Transport/Communication System and Major settlements.</p>
                    <p>In addition, these guidelines also mandate that economic and social factors have to be recognized and assessed while citing industry. Following are the key points that all industries need to follow while moving ahead with the establishment of manufacturing/processing unit in certain areas. These are:</p>

                    <p>In order to help the concerned authorities and the entrepreneurs, it is necessary to frame certain broad guidelines for siting an industry. It is also necessary to identify the parameters that should be taken into account while setting up an industry. With this in view, the following environmental guidelines are recommended for siting of Industries to ensure optimum use of natural and man-made resources in sustainable manner with minimal depletion, degradation and/or destruction of environment. Those are in addition to those directives that are already in existence under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act.</p>

                    <p>In siting industries, care should be taken to minimize the adverse impact of the industries on the immediate neighborhood as well as distant places. Some of the natural life sustaining systems and some specific land uses are sensitive to industrial impacts because of the nature and extent of fragility. With a view to protecting such an industrial site shall maintain the following distances from the areas listed:</p>

                    <p><strong>1.2.2. Siting Criteria</strong></p>
                    <p>Economic and social factors are recognized and assessed while siting an industry. Environmental factors must be taken into consideration in industrial siting. Proximity of water sources, highway, major settlements, markets for products and raw material resources is desired for economy of production, but all the above listed systems must be away for environmental protection. Industries are, therefore, required to be sited, striking a balance between economic and environmental considerations. In such a selected site, the following factors must be recognized.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.2.3. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Objective: </strong>The purpose of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To identify and evaluate the potential impacts (beneficial and adverse) of development and projects on the environmental system.</li>
                        <li>It is a useful aid for decision making based on understanding of the environment implications including social, cultural and aesthetic concerns which could be integrated with the analysis of the project costs and benefits.</li>
                        <li>This exercise should be undertaken early enough in the planning stage of projects for selection of environmentally compatible sites, process technologies and such other environmental safeguards.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Candidate Projects: </strong>While all industrial projects may have some environmental impacts, all of them may not be significant enough to warrant elaborate assessment procedures. The need for such exercises will have to be decided after initial evaluation of the possible implications of a particular project and its location. The projects which could be the candidates for detailed Environment Impact Assessment include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Those which can significantly alter the landscape, land use pattern and lead to concentration of working and service population;</li>
                        <li>Those which need upstream development activity like assured mineral and forest products supply or downstream industrial process development;</li>
                        <li>Those involving manufacture, handling and use of hazardous materials;</li>
                        <li>Those which are sited near ecologically sensitive areas, urban centers, hill resorts, places of scientific and religious importance.</li>
                        <li>Industrial Estates with constituent units of various types which could cumulatively cause significant environmental damage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Factors Addressed:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meteorology and air quality</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Ambient levels of pollutants such as Sulphur Dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, suspended particulate matters, should be determined at the center and at 3 other locations on a radius of 10 km with 120 degrees angle between stations. Additional contribution of pollutants at the locations are required to be predicted after taking into account the emission rates of the pollutants from the stacks of the proposed plant, under different meteorological conditions prevailing in the area.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hydrology and water quality</li>
                        <li>Site and its surroundings</li>
                        <li>Occupational safety and health</li>
                        <li>Details of the treatment and disposal of effluents (liquid, air and solid) and the methods of alternative uses</li>
                        <li>Transportation of raw material and details of material handling</li>
                        <li>Control equipment and measures proposed to be adopted</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>1.2.4. Environmental Management Plan (EMP)</strong></p>
                    <p>Preparation of environmental management plan is required for formulation, implementation and monitoring of environmental protection measures during and after commissioning of projects. The plans should indicate the details as to how various measures have been or are proposed to be taken including cost components as may be required. Cost of measures for environmental safeguards should be treated as an integral component of the project cost and environmental aspects should be taken into account at various stages of the projects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Conceptualization:</strong> preliminary environmental assessment</li>
                        <li><strong>Planning:</strong> detailed studies of environmental impacts and design of safeguards</li>
                        <li><strong>Execution:</strong> implementation of environmental safety measures</li>
                        <li><strong>Operation:</strong> monitoring of effectiveness of built-in safeguards</li>
                    </ul>
